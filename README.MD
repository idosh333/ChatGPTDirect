<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

ChatGPTDirect was created to bypass queues when using `chat.openai.com/chat`.
By using the chatGPT API directly and OpenAI's Python library,
this project became possible. This project was initially made for personal use,
so please use at your own risk.
